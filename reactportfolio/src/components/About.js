        Hi! I am Srilalitha and I am a full-stack Web Developer I love problem
        solving, using my creativity and critical thinking to find solutions. I
        also enjoy working in collaboration with others to find even better
        solutions. Having a curious mind, I donâ€™t mind stepping out of my
        comfort zone because I like the stimulation of learning new things -
        that space of continuous learning that leads to improvement. I also
        enjoy the process of transforming ideas into reality and making things
        happen. In addition, I want to create a positive difference and becoming
        a developer is where I feel I can contribute my skills and passion
